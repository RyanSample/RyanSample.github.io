        <h2>Easy Pizza</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Dough:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>210 g or just under 1 cup of beer(I prefer Incarnation)</li>
            <li>350g or 2 3/4 cups AP flour</li>
            <li>5g or 1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>8g or 1 3/4tsp sugar</li>
            <li>7g or 2 1/4tsp instant yeast(Round up to 3 tsp if using bulk yeast)</li>
            <li>15g or 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Heat beer over low heat for 20-30seconds until the beer is warmer than room temp(98F idealy).</p>
        <p>Into the bowl of a food processor goes the flour, salt, sugar, yeast, and olive oil. Spin these ingredients on high
        until combined.</p>
        <p>Stream in warmed beer and spin until mixture forms a shaggy dough. Once completed put dough on floured surface
        and knead for around one minute</p>
        <p>Divide the dough into two equal balls and cover with a damp towel to rest for 15 minutes</p>
        <p>Finally, Place each ball onto an oiled piece of parchment paper and top with another piece of oiled parchment paper.
        Flatten dough with hand before rolling out with a rolling pin into 14" pieces. Allow each uncooked crust to rise for 30 minutes
        at room temperature. Pre heat oven to 550F(I usually do 500 because I think my house is going to burn down if I go much higher). 
        Now is the time to prep toppings</p>
        <h3>Cooking pizzas</h3>
        <p>At a 550F oven, pizzas should take 6-7minutes</p>
        <p>If you're like me and barely trust that your oven will go higher than 500F Allow an extra couple of minutes.
        You are looking for the crust to start becoming golden on top and the chesse should be slightly browning.</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>I have had my baking sheets warp and make loud noises in the oven, probably another good reason to keep
        the oven at 500F üòÅ</p>
